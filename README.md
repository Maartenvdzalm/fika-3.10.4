# fika-3.9.8
Play Escape from Tarkov with friends on your own private server.

This is a docker image for the backend server component of Single Player Tarkov (SPT v3.9.8) with the Fika multiplayer mod (v2.2.8) already installed. I put this together primarily for the Unraid Community Apps ecosystem and Unraid docker templates for convenience and ease-of-use.

See docker registry: https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/apfaffman/fika-3.9.8
