# fika-3.9.8
Pre-built docker image to run the backend server component of SPT (presently v3.9.8) and the Fika multiplayer component (v2.2.8). I put this together primarily for Unraid users, so they might enjoy this project with the convenience of the Unraid ecosystem and GUI, without having to build the image themselves and with a pretty icon and helpful run option fields.

See docker registry: https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/apfaffman/fika-3.9.8

Unraid template XML and custom icons found here.
